I spent a lot of time trying to validate/invalidate some findings, probably most of my time spent on this.

Invalidated both my H/M findings.

Then I decided to focus on gas optimizations and some QA due to being close to contest deadline.

Was another speedrun contest for me, to try improve my speed.

I probably spent too much time on the math libraries... but all good, part of learning context.

I think the codebase is of high quality, the dev seems to know what they're doing.

The updating of scores implementation is EXCELLENT.

### Time spent:
10 hours
