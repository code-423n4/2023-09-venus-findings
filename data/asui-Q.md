1. Instead of letting the caller pass any address as user and any market in the ```accrueInterestAndUpdateScore``` function in the **Prime.sol** contract take the ```msg.sender``` as user and only the market address as the argument so that no one can act on behalf of anyone .

2. Remove the ```claimInterest(address vToken, address user)``` function since there is already a function that could claim interest: ```function claimInterest(address vToken)```. Besides the first function allows anyone to claim interest for any other user the user still get the tokens but he might not want to claim it yet or he might not know about it. Or if this is a way to claim for users who failed to claim their interest in a long time then allow only the protocol owner or the admin to call it.
