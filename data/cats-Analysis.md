# Introduction
I think the idea behind Venus Prime tying into the ecosystem of an already successful protocol with a long-standing reputation is a good addition. It incentivizes the userbase to stake their native token XVS and allows for liquidity to keep circulating inside the ecosystem and promotes growth within the protocol.

## Analysis of the Codebase
The main contract of the codebase is `Prime.sol`. What I noticed at first glance is that they are using a lot of useful imports for their goal and also an oracle that seems to do it's job quite well. The codebase was in general very neatly done, they had extensive error handling and event logging. It has already been audited multiple times by trad firms as well. Looking at the reports of the past audits, the firms didn't find many vulnerabilities to begin with, so I already knew that it would be tight and hard to find flaws. One thing I liked is that there were validating functions implemented and they were always used in the beginning of functions, following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern quite well without missing anything crucial. Access control was applied properly where needed and there were also functions to pause and unpause in case of emergency.


## Architecture Feedback, Centralization & Systemic Risks
The overall architecture and how ties into the existing ecosystem I would say is superb. I don't think there are any serious centralization issues at all, I've recently seen on some other audits some centralization things that were on the side of "too much" but here it isn't on any crazy level.

One thing I also like is the minimum time that is needed to receive a Prime Token - 90 days. That makes sure the userbase is properly committed to the project in order to reap the benefits.

## Recommendations
One thing I think could be changed is that as far as I understood correctly, in order to make use of your Prime Token, you not only originally need to have 1000XVS staked for 90 days, but also, after you receive your Token, you need to have a minimum stake of 1000XVS active at any given time. I thought that it might be a thought to have e.g. an original 90 day period of 1000 XVS staked, after which that minimum threshold could be dropped to a bit lower, for example 500XVS or so.
