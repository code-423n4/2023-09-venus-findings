SPELLING ERROR: SLoC - #385

CONTRACT NAME: prime.sol
Contract link: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/main/contracts/Tokens/Prime/Prime.sol
LINE OF CODE:  @notice accrues interes and updates score for an user for a specific market.

PoC: The prime.sol contract has a comment of the function accrueInterestAndUpdatesScore on line 385. The comment’s intention is used to explain what the function does, however, the spelling errors can be confusing. If it’s an error, use “interest” instead of “interes” and “for a user” instead of “for an user”  otherwise, update the comment.

TOOLS USED: Manual review

Recommendation: change to 'interest' instead of 'interes'  AND 'for a user' instead of 'for an user'.
