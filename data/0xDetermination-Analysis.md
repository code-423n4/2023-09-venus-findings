# Venus Prime Analysis Report
## Approach
The approach taken in this audit was to first check through the minting, burning, and reward accrual functionalities while assuming that there are no issues in the score calculation. After looking through the aforementioned logic, the details of score calculation were checked, including the math libraries.
## Code Complexity
The codebase is quite complex, including many external calls to other contracts and hooks for other contracts to call. Additionally, there is a lot of code implementing math formulae and functions. More complexity generally translates to more risk of the protocol not functioning correctly.
## Systemic Risks
The hooks in the protocol that only need to be called by certain contracts lack access control. (For example, `Prime.xvsUpdated()` only needs to be called by the XVSVault.) This provides extra attack surface area, which should be eliminated. Access control should be added to these hooks.

Similarly, anyone can call `Prime.claimInterest()` to send any user's accrued rewards to them. This is another functionality that provides extra attack surface area, and adding restrictions here should be seriously considered.

The exponentiation for the score calculation adds additional complexity, perhaps without commensurate gain in functionality. It may be reasonable to remove the exponentiation part of the score calculation, and weight user stakes and supply/borrow balances a different way. For example, variable weighting could be achieved using division.

The functionality to update alpha/multipliers is a point of concern, since user scores cannot be atomically updated with an update of alpha/multiplier. Removing this functionality would reduce the risk of the protocol not functioning correctly.

## Conclusion
The reward accrual mechanism and overall hook-utilizing architecture appear to be robust. It may be possible to reduce complexity in the codebase to reduce risks of the protocol not functioning correctly. Finally, the codebase should be refactored to limit attack surface area wherever possible.
