# `Prime._burn` should delete `stakedAt`


## Impact

`Prime._burn` doesn’t clear `stakedAt[user]`. Usually `stakedAt[user]` would be cleared in `Prime.claim` and `Prime.issue`. But if the governance calls `Prime.issue` to issue an irrevocable token, it won’t clear  `stakedAt[user]`. The user is possible to immediately claim back the prime token after the token is burned by the governor.
