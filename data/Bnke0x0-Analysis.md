## Venus Prime
Venus Protocol is thrilled to introduce Venus Prime, a groundbreaking incentive program designed to fortify user engagement and stimulate growth within the protocol. As an integral component of Venus Tokenomics v3.1, Venus Prime is dedicated to elevating rewards and advancing $XVS staking, with a particular focus on markets such as USDT, USDC, BTC, and ETH.

What sets Venus Prime apart is its innovative self-sustaining rewards system. Instead of relying on external sources, these rewards are generated from the protocol's revenue, creating a sustainable and continually evolving program.

Qualified $XVS holders will be granted an exclusive, non-transferable Soulbound Token, amplifying rewards across carefully selected markets.
