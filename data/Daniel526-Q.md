## A. Reordering Operations in the `setPrimeToken` Function:
[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-venus/blob/b11d9ef9db8237678567e66759003138f2368d23/contracts/Tokens/Prime/PrimeLiquidityProvider.sol#L177-L182)
The `setPrimeToken` function allows the owner of the contract to update the address of the prime token contract and emits an event to notify observers of this change. However, the problem lies in the ordering of operations within the function:
```solidity
_emit PrimeTokenUpdated(prime, prime_);
prime = prime_;
```
Here, the event `PrimeTokenUpdated` is emitted before updating the `prime` state variable with the new address `prime_`. This sequence means that external contracts or observers listening to this event will receive the old value of prime, not the updated one. It can lead to external code relying on outdated information, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
## Impact:
The impact of this issue is that external code relying on the emitted event may make decisions or take actions based on outdated information about the address of the prime token contract. This could result in errors, inconsistencies, or vulnerabilities in the behavior of the contract or interacting contracts.
## Mitigation:
To address this issue, the order of operations in the `setPrimeToken` function should be corrected. The state variable `prime` should be updated before emitting the event, as follows:
```solidity
function setPrimeToken(address prime_) external onlyOwner {
    _ensureZeroAddress(prime_);

    prime = prime_;  // Update the state variable first
    emit PrimeTokenUpdated(prime, prime_); // Then emit the event
}
```
