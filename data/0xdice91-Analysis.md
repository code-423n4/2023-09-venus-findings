# Analysis - Venus Prime Contest


## Approach
During my audit, I focused on understanding the mechanisms of Venus Prime, and its integration with the Venus protocol, my approach to this audit is as follows
- Read the docs detailing Venus Prime.
- Understand how funds come in and out of Venus Prime.
- Read the contracts in scope line by line and understand every function and how they interact with each other
- Track the flow of users into and out of Venus Prime
- Write questions down (on how things can go wrong, and how a malicious user can go about causing harm to the protocol).
- Write down my issues found.
- Read the docs again, and research similar protocols and issues they usually face.
- Write my report.

## Architecture recommendations
I started by reading the documentation thoroughly to get a full grasp of the Venus protocol, what Venus Prime is and how they are interrelated and work hand in hand. I spent time understanding the Cobb-Douglas Function and how it is used in defi, In general, I believe the architecture of the protocol is sound especially the mechanism used to calculate its rewards system, though nothing is ever really perfect, Everything seems fine and the code implements the Cobb-Douglas Function exceptionally well, taking in account the different always changing variables that the defi space presents.
## Codebase Quality
As a whole, I consider the code execution to be excellent and its docs did well to express its rewards mechanism, something worth noting would be the simplicity of the protocol and how the implementation of its functions was so understandable, I really had a good time auditing this protocol, below is my review of the different aspects of the codebase.
| Codebase Quality Categories  | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| **Unit Testing**  | The Codebase was actually well-tested for the most part, although the use of foundry would have been more appreciated.|
| **Code Comments**  | Comments and Natspecs in general were easy to understand and straight to the point. Although in some cases more info would have been helpful, I would also like to note that some functions comments then were a little bit misleading but overall on a scale of 1-10 I'll give them an 8 |
| **Documentation** | The docs explained how the reward system works from a basic contract level making it easier to digest as an auditor, The docs tackled all the major contracts and their functionalities and also provided a great deal of help in understanding the implementation of their mechanisms with even pseudo-code, |
| **Organization** | The Codebase was actually so easy and simple removing complexities that made it look mature and well organized with clear distinctions between the contracts, and how they interact with each other to help aid their functionalities |
## Centralization Risks
The use of the Timelock contract as the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE made the architecture of Venus Prime more decentralised and different delays are a welcomed addition.
## Mechanism Review
The mechanism used for Venus Prime is commended as it has been used and tested in the field by other protocols before being used here, The implementations are very easy to grasp and work very well according to the tests I did, and due to the nature of the protocol I think it should go by easily in terms of calculation of rewards and token acquisition, with the upgradeability brought to Venus Prime, I think that any issue that might come up later on can easily be tackled.
## Systematic Risks
There is a possibility of some rewards being lost forever because of the score system used for Venus Prime and the miscalculation of the rewards when score updates are in progress as the total score of members of a particular market is used in calculations which does not reflect the true current score of the members of that market but these are just minimal issues.
## Conclusion
I really applaud the Venus protocol team for the creation of Venus Prime as it is a brilliant, well-executed idea that will encourage high stakes for longer periods of time into the Venus protocol. its use and implementation of the modified Cobb-Douglas function for reward calculation is excellent and well executed.
